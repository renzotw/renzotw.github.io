# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

<img align="right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pfp.jpg" width="250" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px;" class="rounded-corners" />

I'm a recent graduate of UCLA and currently working as a management consultant at Kearney in San Francisco. 

My past experiences include ML research, corporate finance and supply chain strategy, and pro-bono consulting.

In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, playing basketball, exploring new restaurants, and occasionally cooking.

I created this blog to document various personal projects as well as to start writing down anything from my thoughts to life updates to articles.
