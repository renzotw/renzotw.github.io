# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate of UCLA where I studied Financial Mathematics and Computing. I am currently working as a management consultant at Kearney in San Francisco. 

My past experiences include ML research, corporate finance and supply chain strategy, and pro-bono consulting.

I created this blog to document various personal projects as well as to start writing down anything from my thoughts to life updates to articles.
