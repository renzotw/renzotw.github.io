I'm a recent graduate of UCLA where I studied Financial Mathematics and Computing. I am currentyl working as a management consultant at [Kearney](https://kearney.com/) in San Francisco. 

My past experiences include ML research at [Liberty Mutual](https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/corporate-information/overview), corporate finance and supply chain strategy at [RH](https://rh.com/), and pro-bono consulting with [Consult Your Community](https://consultyourcommunity.org/).

I created this blog to document various personal projects as well as to start writing down anything from my thoughts to life updates to articles.
