# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate of UCLA where I studied Financial Mathematics and Computing. Starting August 2022 I will be working as a management consultant at [Kearney](kearney.com) in San Francisco. 

My past experiences include ML research at Liberty Mutual, coporate finance and supply chain strategy at RH, and pro-bono consulting with Consult Your Community.

I created this blog to document various personal projects as well as to get inspired to write down thoughts and reflections.
