4 Lessons I learned from my time at UCLA

----

I recently walked the stage to officially mark the end of my undergraduate career at UCLA. Technically, I graduated a quarter early, in Winter 2022, but I hadn't truly reflected on my college experience since then; instead I've enjoyed my well deserved time off traveling the world, sleeping-in, and doing anything but school. But after a long week of bittersweet graduation ceremonies and celebrations, it finally dawned on me that my time at UCLA was coming to an end. With that I wanted to write down a few lessons I learned over the past four years as a reflection of my experience and as a note for myself to look back on. 

### &ensp; 1. Relationships take effort
To simply put it, relationships in college (with professors, mentors, friends, etc.) take effort. 

College is a unique social environment - you are surrounded by thousands of kids your age, countless professors and TAs, and hundreds of campus clubs and organizations. With so many people to meet and interact with, the responsibility then falls on you to decide who you will spend your time with and how you will build and maintain those relationships.

During my first year of college I hesitated to reach out to my professors and TAs. Perhaps I was nervous or just too naive to seek help, but I failed to utilize the academic resources I had at my disposal. I quickly learned that it was on me to take that extra step to go to my professors to seek help on homework or to simply chat with them about their interests. With time my professors began to recognize me, learning my name and face. Through countless conversations I gained a deeper understanding of course materials, learned about prospective career paths, and received a tremendous amount of advice. Establishing such relationships with my professors and TAs helped make as big a school as UCLA feel small and personal.

The same went for friends. In college everyone is extremely busy with their own lives, having to balance academics, work, clubs, and a social life among many other things. Amongst all of the chaos that college is, I found that it‚Äôs easy to maintain friendships with a close few but that it takes quite a bit of effort to maintain relationships and friendships with everyone else. As with academics it was on me to reach out to people I wanted to stay in touch with. Over the past four years there were many times where I missed the opportunity to reach out to mentors and friends that graduated ahead of me, so as I entered my last year of school I made an attempt to reach out to friends I wanted to see or hang out with one last time. It was important for me to sustain the relationships I had developed throughout college so I took every opportunity I could to spend time with friends.

While I may not see many people again as I move away from college, I hope to stay in touch with as many friends as I can!

### &ensp; 2. Don't follow the herd

> "Don't follow the herd"

This was a quote that my old neighbor (a fellow UCLA undergrad and Anderson MBA alum) told me once when I asked her for career advice. She said that your career path doesn‚Äôt have to be linear and more importantly you shouldn't compare yourself to anyone else. 

Until recently I found it difficult to actually equip this mindset.

In college everything can feel like a competition - from succedding in cutthroat classes to acheiving perfect grades to getting internships. From the onset it feels like a rat race to the most glamorous jobs, the most prestigious grad school programs, and the highest marks and grades in classes. UCLA is a competitive school and the large student body makes the race feel even more imminent. 

As a freshman I applied to many of the schools most applied to business and finance clubs with a mere acceptance rate of <5%. The opportunities seemed limited as I received rejections from most and failed interviews with the others. Whenever I compared myself to my peers who got accepted into these respective clubs, I felt demoralized and discouraged. How was I supposed to compete with people who had perfct GPAs, internships in high school, and better connections than I had?

Four years later as recruiting season came around for full-time jobs, I fell into the same trap of comparing myself to my peers. I was recruiting for competitive positions in Data Science, Consulting, and Finance and couldn't help but compare myself to my peers who were recruiting for the same jobs. Like my Freshman year self, I felt less accomplished than many of my peers and feared rejection from my target firms.

However, this quote that my neighbor had shared with me helped me break this mindset. I finally realized that everyone has their own path and that there are in fact many different paths to achieving the same goal. It was ok if I had a different path as long as I kept trying and putting myslef out there. 

As for myself, I started out as a confused Econ major eyeing for brand-name internships in Finance. However, I eventually joined amazing campus orgs in PSE and CYC and explored consulting, swithced my major to Financial Mathematics and explored a carrer in Actuarial Science and Data Science, and as a senior I circled back to exploring opportunities in Finance. My path allowed me to explore many career opportunities and challenged me to find what I really wanted for myself. It may have taken me four years to stop comparing myself to others, but I eventually found solace in my own path. 

People say comparison is the thief of joy, and in college this idea is ever so relevant. We are constanly surrounded by bright and inspiring people so recognizing that everyone has their own path and that it is ok to have a different path is crucial.

### &ensp; 3. Try everything / Be ok with being uncomfortable

This one is straight forward but try everything! Just like I mentioned above it's important to explore new ideas and experiences because who knows if it will lead to you finding a new major or career or hobby. College is the perfect environment to gain new experiences because there are just so many opportunities available. In fact placing yourself in uncomfortable scenarios will challenge you and help you discover things about yourself that you might've not known before. 

For myself I found a new major; Learned to code; Competed in IMs; Participated in UCLA's UniCamp and had a blast; Started rock climbing and now consider it a hobby; Picked up coooking and so much more

### &ensp; 4. Be your own harshest critic

In college you have to be your own harshest critic. For many, as with myself, it is the first time living on our own away from home and we're forced to be fully responsible for ourselves and our actions. This new sense of freedom often makes it easy to lose sight of goals and aspirations. 

With the new freedom that college afforded me, I found myself slacking off, and in my first year of college I earned grades that I had never received before in my life. Naturally I became my harshest critic and pushed myself for the remaining years of college. I challenged myself to do better and held myself to higher standards. 

This is a mindset that I will carry with me as I start my new job. I hope to keep pushing myself to higher standards to see what I can accomplish. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far and go bruins :)
