I recently walked the stage to officially mark the end of my undergraduate career at UCLA. Technically, I graduated a quarter early, in Winter 2022, but I had not truly reflected on my college experience since then; instead I enjoyed my well deserved time off traveling, sleeping-in, and thinking about anything but school. But after a weekend of bittersweet graduation ceremonies and celebrations, it finally dawned on me that my time at UCLA was coming to an end. With that I wanted to write down a few lessons I learned over the past four years as a reflection of my experience and as a note for myself to look back on. 

### &ensp; 1. Relationships take effort
To simply put it relationships in college (with professors, mentors, friends) take effort. 

College is a uniquely social environment. You are constanly surrounded by thousands of kids your age and countless professors and TAs.
### &ensp; 2. Don't follow the herd
### &ensp; 3. Try everything
### &ensp; 4. Be ok with being uncomfortable
### &ensp; 5. Be your own harshest critic
