5 Lessons I learned from my time at UCLA

I recently walked the stage to officially mark the end of my undergraduate career at UCLA. Technically, I graduated a quarter early, in Winter 2022, but I hadn't truly reflected on my college experience since then; instead I enjoyed my well deserved time off traveling the world, sleeping-in, and thinking about anything but school. But after a weekend of bittersweet graduation ceremonies and celebrations, it finally dawned on me that my time at UCLA was coming to an end. With that I wanted to write down a few lessons I learned over the past four years as a reflection of my experience and as a note for myself to look back on. 

### &ensp; 1. Relationships take effort
To simply put it, relationships in college (with professors, mentors, friends, etc.) take effort. 

College is a unique social environment - you are surrounded by thousands of kids your age, countless professors and TAs, and hundreds of campus clubs and organizations. With so many people to meet and interact with, the responsibility then falls on you to decide who you will spend your time with and how you will build and maintain those relationships.

During my first year of college I hesitated to reach out to my professors and TAs. Perhaps I was nervous or just too naive to seek help, but I failed to utilize the academic resources I had at my disposal. I quickly learned that it was on me to take that extra step to go to my professors to seek help or to simply chat with them. With time my professors began to recognize me, learning my name and face. Through countless conversations I gained a deeper understanding of course materials, learned about prospective career paths, and received a tremendous amount of advice. Establishing such relationships with my professors and TAs helped make as big a school as UCLA feel small and personal. 

The same went for friends. In college everyone is extremely busy with their own lives, having to balance academics, work, clubs, and a social life among many other things. Amongst all of the chaos that college is, I found that it‚Äôs easy to maintain friendships with a close few but that it takes quite a bit of effort to maintain relationships and friendships with everyone else. As with academics it was on me to reach out to people I wanted to stay in touch with. Over the past four years there were many times where I missed the opportunity to reach out to mentors and friends that graduated ahead of me, so as I entered my last year of school I made an attempt to reach out to friends I wanted to see to hang out or grab food/drinks with. It was important for me to sustain relationships I had developed throughout college so I took every opportunity I could to spend time with friends.

While I may not see many people again as I move away from college, I hope to stay in touch with as many friends as I can :)

### &ensp; 2. Don't follow the herd

This was a quote that my old neighbor (a fellow UCLA undergrad and Anderson MBA alum) told me once when I asked her for career advice. She said that your career path doesn‚Äôt have to be linear and more importantly you shouldn't compare yourself to anyone. 

Unitl recently I found it difficult to actually equip this mindset. In college everything can feel like a competition - from classes to grades to 



### &ensp; 3. Try everything
### &ensp; 4. Be ok with being uncomfortable
### &ensp; 5. Be your own harshest critic
