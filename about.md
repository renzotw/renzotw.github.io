I'm currently a senior at UCLA studying Financial Mathematics with a Concentration in Computing. I'm interested in equity reseach, fixed income, management consulting, and tech. 

I will be working full time as a management consultant at [`Kearney`](https://www.kearney.com/) following graduation. 

In my free time I enjoy playing sports including basketball, volleyball, sailing, and golf. I also enjoy traveling, hiking, going to the beach, and exploring new restaurants.
