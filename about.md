I'm currently a senior at UCLA studying Financial Mathematics with a Concentration in Computing. I'm interested in equity reseach, management consulting, and tech. 

My past experiences include machine learning research at [Liberty Mutual](https://www.libertymutual.com/), coporate finance and supply chain at [RH](https://rh.com/), and pro-bono consulting through [Consult Your Community](https://www.cycucla.org/).

I will be working full time as a management consultant at [Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/) following graduation. 

In my free time I enjoy playing sports including basketball, beach volleyball, skiing. Recently I've learned how to sail and play golf. I also enjoy traveling, hiking, going to the beach, and exploring new restaurants.
