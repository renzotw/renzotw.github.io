title: Web Development with Flask
---

In this blog post we will create a dynamic website using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), a web development framework in Python. The code for this project can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/renzotw/pic16-demo-site).

# §1. Prerequisites
 
In odrer to set up the flask environment, we first need to install the flask package in our Python environment. Start by running the following code in terminal:


```python
conda activate PCI_16B
conda install -c anaconda flask
```

Now, flask is installed in our environment and we can use it to create a website locally. The following linux commands will allow us to get a local preview of our website - this is useful to see any changes to our website as they are made.


```python
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

# §2. Website Anatomy

Throughout this tutorial we will create a dynamic website that asks users to submit a message and name, stores the submissions in a `sqlite3` database, and prints a random list of messages for the user to view. In addition, this website will involve interactive features from submission boxes to submit buttons to navigation links. 

Let's begin this project by identifying the high-level structure of our website:

- Enable submissions
- Interact with database
- Return messages stored in database

## §2a. Enable Submissions

Let's first create a submit template with three user interface elements:

1. A text box for submitting a message.
2. A text box for submitting the name of the user.
3. A “submit” button.

We start by creating a file called `app.py`. This will be the main body of our Python code. On the very top of this file we install the necessary packages.


```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request

import sqlite3
import click

import random 
import string
```

Next, we create our flask instance by running:


```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

We will enable submissions by creating navigation links within a `base.html` file that takes us to a submission page -  `submit.html`. `submit.html` extends `base.html`, meaning it will inheret any formatting specifified in the parent file. The following is some higlighted html code in `base.html` for navigation.


```html
<nav>
  <h1>Awesome Message Bank</h1>
  <b>Navigation:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">Submit a message</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('view') }}">View messages</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

As we can see there are two list items that say "Submit a message" for submission and "View messages" for viewing the submissions, which will be discussed later on. These are the navigation links for our webite. We now refer back to `app.py` to create a route to view `base.html`. This is our home page.


```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
    """
    Function to render the home page 
    """
    return render_template("base.html") # Searches in template directory for main.html
```

An important feature of this function is `render_template()`. When returned, this function will render the inputtsed html code and allow the flask to interact with it. In this case we will be able to see the navigation links that we wrote in `base.html`.

Now we will create `submit.html` to create our submit page and implement a function to interact with it. Here is some select chtml code:

```html
{% raw %}
{% block content %}
  <form method="post">
      <label for="message">Your message:</label>
      <br>
      <input type="text" name="message" id="message">
      <br>
      <label for="name">Your name or handle:</label>
      <br>
      <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
      <br>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit message">
  </form>
  {% if (name) and (message) %}
  <br>
  <b>Hello {{name}}, Thank you for submitting your message! </b>
  {% else %}
  <b> Please submit all entries </b>
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
```


This html code extends `base.html`, methods to allow for submissions, and error conditions. Under `method='post'`, users can interact with the website to input a message and name. If both submissions are entered, the page will then thank the user for their submission.

![SubmitResponse.png](/images/SubmitResponse.png)


However, if one or both entries are missing, the website will tell the user to submit all entries.



![NameError.png](/images/NameError.png)
![ErrorResponse.png](/images/ErrorResponse.png)


Now, let's look at the corresponding Python function that interacts with user submissions. The particular flask route for submissions includes a `POST` and `GET` method, which allows users to both post and receive messages. When the method is `GET`, `submit.html` is rendered, and if the method is `POST` we call on the function `insert_message(request)` to write to our database and render `submit.html` with the correpsponding entries for name and message. This will return a response for a successful submission. 


```python
@app.route("/submit/", methods = ["POST", "GET"])
def submit():
    """
    Function for submitting messages
    """
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("submit.html")
    else:
        try:
            insert_message(request) # Run insert_message() to write to sql database
            return render_template("submit.html", name=request.form['name'], message=request.form['message']) # Return submit html with successful submission message
        except:
            return render_template("submit.html")

```

## §2b. Database Interaction

After submitting a name and message to our website, we want to be able to store the information somewhere. We will do this by interacting with a `sqlite3` database. In this section we will discuss two functions used to instantiate a database connection and write to it. 

Let's create a function called `get_message_db()`. This function will instantiate a connection to a database and create a `messages` table if one does not exist. Within the first lines of our function we speciofy `g.` to denote the current global request.


```python
def get_message_db():
    """
    Function to initialize database and return open connection
    If database exists simply return the connection
    """
    if 'db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('message_db.sqlite')

    conn = g.message_db
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create table if it doesn't exist
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, handle TEXT, message TEXT);")
    
    return g.message_db   
```

Now let's create a function `insert_message(request)` to save submissions to the database. Several key points to note in this function are that it calls on `get_message_db()` to open the connection, write into our database with a sql query, and finally, close the connection. 


```python
def insert_message(request):
    """
    Funciton to return the inputted name and message and write to sql database
    """
    message = request.form["message"]
    handle = request.form["name"]

    db = get_message_db() # Open connection to database
    error = None

    # Error cases
    if not message:
        error = "message is required."
    elif not handle:
        error = "name is required."

    if error is None:
        db.execute("INSERT INTO messages (handle, message) VALUES (?,?)", (handle, message)) # Query to write to database
        db.commit() # Commit changes to database

    db.close() # Close connection to database when done

    return message, handle
```

With these two function, we can now save our submissions from part 1a!

## §2c. Return Messages

Finally, we want to be able to view the messages that have been submitted. To do this we will follow a familiar proccess and create a navigation link to a `view.html` file with corresponding functions to interact witht the database. We will define a function `random_messages(n)` to generate n random messages from our database. Like `insert_message(request)` we will close the database after interacting with it. This function returns a list of tuples that specify a message and corresponding name.


```python
def random_messages(n):
    """
    Function to return a random list of messages
    """

    db = get_message_db()

    cursor = db.cursor()

    cursor.execute("SELECT message, handle FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT (?)", (n,))
    messages = cursor.fetchall() # List of tuples of messages and names

    db.close()  # Close connection when done

    return messages

```

We also need a function to interact with the view navigation link. `view()` specifies a cap of how many messages to show and calls on `random_messages(n)` to generate such many messages. Finally, it renders `veiw.html` which will display the messages.


```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():
    """
    Function to view up to as many messages as stated in limit
    """
    limit = 5 # Cap of how many messages to display
    mylist = random_messages(limit) # Run random_messages() to get a list of tuples of random messages
    return render_template('view.html', message_list=mylist)

```

Here is selected html code from `view.html` which extracts the tuple elements from the messsages list.


```html
{% raw %}
{% block content %}
  {% for content in message_list %}
  <br>
  <b>{{content.0}}</b>
  <br>
  <i>{{content.1}}</i>
  <br>
  {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
{% endraw %}
```

Whsn this code is run we can succesfully see the submissions in our database!

# §3. Customizing out Website

We are almost done with our website! As a last step, we will customize the layout of our site with css code. We can change the font type, background color, as well as any formatting. Here is some select code:


```css
html {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    background: rgb(237, 247, 220);
    padding: 1rem;
}

a {
    color: CornflowerBlue;
    text-decoration: none;
}

.content {
    padding: 0 1rem 1rem;
    background: rgb(214, 219, 214);
    border-radius: 25px;
}
```

With this customization our website goes from this
