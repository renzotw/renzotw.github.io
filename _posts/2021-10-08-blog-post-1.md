# Interactive Data Visualization in Python

In this blog post we will first learn how to create and query databases, and then we will create interactive data visualizations on data extracted from our database.

# ยง1. Creating a Database

We will begin this exercise by creating and populating a database with three separate tables: `temperatures`, `stations`, and `countries`. To do this we will use the `sqlite3` package, which enables us to work with databases using Python commands.


```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
```

The first thing we should do is to instatiate a connection to an empty database.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("noaa.db")
```

## 1a. Temperatures Table

Now that we have created a connection, we can start populating the database with tables. Let's start with the `temperatures` data. 


```python
temps_df = pd.read_csv("temps.csv")
```


```python
# Original temperatures data
temps_df.head()
```

As we can see every row in the data contains an ID, year, and monthly temperatures across the given year. For ease of analysis we will clean this data. We do this by stacking the monthly temperatures.


```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    Custom function to stack monthly temperatures by ID and Year:
    df = dataframe to clean
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```


```python
# Inspect cleaned data
prepare_df(temps_df).head()
```

```python
# Size of new data
prepare_df(temps_df).size
```




    55970648



As we can see this table is stacked and simpler to interpret! However, the data now contains over 50 million rows. Since this data is very large, we will create an iterator object and write the `temperatures` table by chunk. We use the `df.to_sql()` method to write to our specified table, and we specify `if_exists = append` in order to append the chunks across each iteration.


```python
# Read in data as an iterator
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)

# Write the temperatures table by chunk
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

Now we should have a table called `temperatures` in our database. We can check to see this is true:


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('temperatures',)]


## 1b. Stations Table

Next, we will similarly create a `stations` table in our database.


```python
# Read in station metadata
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
```


```python
stations.head()
```

    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




```python
stations.size
```




    137925



Since this data is much smaller, we can read it in at once. We specify `if_exists = replace` so that we don't accidentally create duplicate tables.


```python
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Let's check that our database contains two tables:


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('temperatures',), ('stations',)]


## 1c. Countries Table

Finally, we create a `countries` table in our database.


```python
# Read in country codes data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(url)
# Remove space in columns
countries.columns = countries.columns.str.replace(" ", "")
```


```python
countries.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {

    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }

      <th>FIPS10-4</th>
      <th>ISO3166</th>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th>0</th>

      <td>AF</td>

      <td>American Samoa</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>




```python
countries.size
```




    837




```python
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```


```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('temperatures',), ('stations',), ('countries',)]


As we can see there are now three tables in our database. Since we are done writing into our database, let's close our connection.


```python
conn.close()
```

# ยง2. Writing a Query Function

In this section, we will write a query function that outputs a dataframe containing information of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    Function that outputs dataframe containing temperature data based on:
    country = string giving the name of a country 
    year_begin = integer for earliest year
    year_end = integer for latest year
    month = integer for month of interest
    """
    # SQL query to extract merge tables and extract data based on conditions
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Name, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.ID = S.ID
    LEFT JOIN countries C on C.`FIPS10-4` = SUBSTRING (T.ID, 1, 2)
    WHERE C.NAME = ? 
        AND T.Year BETWEEN ? and ?
        AND T.Month = ?
    """
    # Create a connection to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect("noaa.db")
    # Execute SQL query and write to a pandas dataframe
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params=(country, year_begin, year_end, month))
    df = df.rename(columns = {"Name":"Country"})
    # Close connection when complete
    conn.close()
    return df
```


```python

                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1).head()

As we can see, this custom query function outputs the January temperature data for all stations in India.

# ยง3. Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

Next, we will write a function to create a data visualization that addresses the following question: 

> **How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?** 

To do this we will first need a method to reflecct an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during a specified month at each station. For this, we will use linear regression to get the coefficient of `Year` when regressed against `Temp`.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from plotly import express as px
import calendar
```

We will use the following function to run linear regression and extract the coefficients.


```python
def coef(data):
    """
    Function that extracts coefficients of linear regression
    """
    x = data[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
    y = data["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```

Now that we have a function for coefficients, we will write a function to do the actual plotting. We will use the `express` module of `plotly` which provides access to various Plotly tools. In particular, we call `px.scatter_mapbox()` to plot our data.


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    Function that plots yearly temperature changes based on:
    country = string giving the name of a country 
    year_begin = integer for earliest year
    year_end = integer for latest year
    month = integer for month of interest
    min_obs = minimum number of years worth of data in specified month
    **kwargs = Additional arguments for plot
    """
    # Query database to get data
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    # Subset data by minimum observations
    df = df.groupby(["NAME"]).filter(lambda x: len(x) >= min_obs)
    # Calculate coefficients and reshape dataframe
    df = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef).reset_index()
    # Rename coefficient columns
    df = df.rename(columns = {0:"Estimated Yearly Increase (\N{DEGREE SIGN}C)"})
    # Round coefficients to 4 significant figures
    df = df.round({"Estimated Yearly Increase (\N{DEGREE SIGN}C)":4})
    # Create scatter plot of data
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df,
                            title = \

We have cerated our first interactive data visualization! This plot shows how average yearly change in temperature varies within Japan. We observe that the southern region of the country has a smaller increase in termperature, while the northern region has greater temperature increases.

# ยง4. Additional Data Visualizations

We will now proceed to create two additional data visualizations following similar steps of querying the database and constructing interactive graphs. Our first plot will answer the question:

> **How do the average temperatures in a given country change over time?**

To answer this, we will create a time series plot that allows us to compare the average temperatures over time for different countries. We start by creating a new query function. Since we will have a dynamic list of countries, our query function will output a dataframe that contains the information of all countries and their stations, as well as their corresponding dates and temperatures.


```python
def query_climate_database2(year_begin, year_end):
    """
    Function that queries temperature data based on:
    year_begin = integer for earliest year
    year_end = integer for latest year
    """
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT C.Name, S.NAME, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.ID = S.ID
    LEFT JOIN countries C on C.`FIPS10-4` = SUBSTRING (T.ID, 1, 2)
    WHERE T.Year BETWEEN ? and ?
    """
    conn = sqlite3.connect("noaa.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn, params=(year_begin, year_end))
    df = df.rename(columns = {"Name":"Country"})
    conn.close()
    return df
```


```python
query_climate_database2(1980, 1981).head()
```

We can customize this graph by changing the time period and countries displayed. 

Finally, let's make one more plot that answers the question:

> **How does the temperature in a country change by elevation?**

This particular visualization will compare two countries and their estimated yearly increase in temperature according to a station's elevation. The yearly increase in temperature will be computed using the `coefs()` function we defined earlier. Our query function will display the elevation and temperature data for every station in the two countries we specify.

We are done! This graph compares two countries and shows their estimated yearly incerase in temperature in a given month based on a station's elevation. From the plots above we can see that on average Japan has had a higher estimated yearly increase in their temperature for stations under an elevation of 4k.
